The Singleton Pattern is a design pattern that ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. In Python, you can implement
the Singleton Pattern by defining a class with a method that creates an instance of the class if it doesn't exist, and returns the existing instance if it does.

Here's a simple example in Python:

python
Copy code
class Singleton:
    _instance = None  # Private variable to store the instance

    def __new__(cls):
        if cls._instance is None:
            cls._instance = super(Singleton, cls).__new__(cls)
        return cls._instance

# Example usage:
singleton_instance1 = Singleton()
singleton_instance2 = Singleton()

print(singleton_instance1 is singleton_instance2)  # Output: True
In this example, the __new__ method is overridden to create an instance only if _instance is None. If an instance already exists, it returns the existing instance. 
This ensures that there is only one instance of the class.

When you create multiple instances (like singleton_instance1 and singleton_instance2 in the example), they refer to the same object, demonstrating the Singleton Pattern.
