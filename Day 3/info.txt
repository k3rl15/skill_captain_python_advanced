Iterator:

1. **Definition:** An iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol, consisting of the `__iter__` and `__next__` methods.
  
2. **Usage:** You can create an iterator using a class by implementing the `__iter__` and `__next__` methods. The `__iter__` method should return the iterator object 
itself, and `__next__` should return the next element in the sequence.

3. **Example:**
   ```python
   class MyIterator:
       def __iter__(self):
           self.num = 0
           return self

       def __next__(self):
           if self.num < 5:
               self.num += 1
               return self.num
           else:
               raise StopIteration

   my_iter = MyIterator()
   for i in my_iter:
       print(i)
   ```

Generator:

1. **Definition:** A generator is a special type of iterator that is defined using a function with the `yield` keyword. Generators simplify the process of writing iterators.

2. **Usage:** Generators are more concise than iterators. The `yield` statement allows a function to produce a sequence of values over time. When a generator function 
is called, it returns a generator iterator, which can be iterated using a `for` loop or by calling the `next` function.

3. **Example:**
   ```python
   def my_generator():
       num = 0
       while num < 5:
           yield num
           num += 1

   gen_iter = my_generator()
   for i in gen_iter:
       print(i)
   ```

Key Differences:

- **Memory Usage:** Generators are more memory-efficient than iterators because they produce values on-the-fly and don't store the entire sequence in memory.
  
- **Syntax:** Generators use a simpler syntax with the `yield` keyword, while iterators require the implementation of `__iter__` and `__next__` methods.

- **State:** Generators automatically save and restore their state, making it easier to work with sequences of data.

In summary, while both iterators and generators allow you to work with sequences of data, generators provide a more concise and memory-efficient way to achieve the same result.
