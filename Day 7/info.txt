Here's a simple example of how to connect to a MySQL database and perform a query:

```python
import mysql.connector

# Replace these with your own database information
host = "your_database_host"
user = "your_username"
password = "your_password"
database = "your_database_name"

# Establish the connection
connection = mysql.connector.connect(
    host=host,
    user=user,
    password=password,
    database=database
)

# Create a cursor object to interact with the database
cursor = connection.cursor()

# Example: execute a query
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM your_table_name")

# Fetch all the rows
result = cursor.fetchall()

# Display the results
for row in result:
    print(row)

# Close the cursor and connection
cursor.close()
connection.close()
